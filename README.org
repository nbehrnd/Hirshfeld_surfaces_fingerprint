* Background

  Reading crystallographic models as =*.cif= file,
  CrystalExplorer[fn:1] is capable to assess the electronic
  interactions of a molecule with its surrounding crystal.  This is
  visualized with Hirshfeld surfaces,[fn:2] and may be projected as a
  2D fingerprint map.[fn:3]

  Carter /et al./ suggest the inspection of /the differences/ of these
  2D fingerprint maps[fn:4] to ease discern of similarities and
  differences when comparing these fingerprints: Contrasting to a
  qualitative discern of the maps (e.g. =compare= by
  ImageMagick),[fn:5] this approach allows both a visual as well as
  numeric quantification of the differences.  This is illustrated
  below with the example of two crystallographic model data describing
  two polymorphs of benzamide (fig. [[alignment]]).  The scope of this
  analysis may be extended to iso-structural materials, too.

* Basic use

  The following sequence describes the analysis of the two benzamide
  model data on Linux Xubuntu 18.04.3LTS with CrystalExplorer
  (version 17.5).  The results of computation were visualized with
  =gnuplot= (version 5.2.7beta).

  By default CrystalExplorer removes intermediate working files,
  including the =.csx= this analysis requires.  To retain this
  information, access the preferences menu (File -> Preferences) and
  uncheck the corresponding entry located under the expert tab. Now
  close the preference menu and load the =*.cif= file in question.
  Compute the Hirshfeld surface at /very high/ resolution (i.e., one
  level higher than by default).

** Direct work with =fingerprint.f90=, =diff_finger.c= and =sum_abs_diffs.rb=

     The =*.cxs= files generated by CrystalExplorer are to be
     normalized by =fingerprint.90=,[fn:6] requiring a compiler such
     as =gfortran=[fn:12] or =gcc=[fn:7] to compile an executable by
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
       gfortran fingerprint.f90 -o fingerprint.x
     #+END_SRC
     and subsequently deployed in a a pattern of
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
       ./fingerprint.x  input.cxs [standard | translated | extended] output.dat
     #+END_SRC
     with =standard=, =translated=, or =extended= as three, mutually
     excluding map ranges to consider ([0.4,2.6], [0.8,3.0], or
     [0.4,3.0] \AA) for the normalized 2D fingerprint map deposit in
     file =output.dat=.

     The computation of the /difference map/ of 2D fingerprints
     requires =diff_finger.c= to be compiled, e.g. with =gcc=[fn:7] by
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     gcc diff_finger.c -o diff_finger
     #+END_SRC
     and the subsequent deployment of the executable in a pattern of
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
       ./diff_finger input_A.dat input_B.dat > difference.dat
     #+END_SRC
     to compute the difference map deposit in =difference.dat=.
     Requiring an installation of Ruby, these difference maps may be
     condensed to a single figure of merit print to the CLI by a call
     of
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     ruby sum_abs_diffs.rb difference.dat
     #+END_SRC

     Sub-folder =plot2gnuplot= contains =bash= scripts to facilitate
     the /visual inspection/ of either 2D fingerprint, or difference
     map with gnuplot[fn:10] if called in a pattern like
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell 
       ./plot_finger_png.sh BZAMID01.dat
     #+END_SRC
     As indicated in the file names of these =bash= scripts, the output
     format of the plots generated by =gnuplot= is either bitmap
     =*.png=, or resolution independent =*.pdf=.  Possibly, they
     require provision of the executable bit by (=chmod u+x
     example.sh=) to work after check-out.

** Python moderated interaction

     Starting with this release, Python script =Hirshfeld_moderator.py=
     is set up to facilitate the interaction with the =*.cxs= files in
     Linux.  Its /help/ menu is invoked by
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     python3 Hirshfeld_moderator.py -h
     #+END_SRC

     After its deposit with =fingerprint.f90=, =diff_finger.c=, and
     =sum_abs_diffs.rb= into the root of the project, the suggested
     sequence to work with this wrapper is to /list/ (toggle =-l=),
     then to /copy/ (toggle =-c=) the =*.cxs= into a dedicated
     sub-folder, =cxs_workshop=.  The two operations retrieve the raw
     data =*.cxs= either in the same root folder as the current
     working directory, or in sub-folders to the current work
     directory.  If present, the file names of =*.cxs= files /already
     copied to =cxs_workshop=/ are automatically truncated at first
     underscore.

     The /normalization/ of the =*.cxs= yielding 2D fingerprint =*.dat=
     files (extended map range) is invoked by the toggle =-n=.  The
     script stops at this level if either the source code,
     =fingerprint.f90=, is missing; or if the compilation with either
     =gfortan= (default), or =gcc= (backup solution) fails.

     The /computation of difference maps/ is launched by toggle =-c=
     with all 2D fingerprint maps identified in sub-folder
     =cxs_workshop=.  Again, the moderator script will halt the
     execution if either the source code, =diff_finger.c= is missing,
     or if the compilation of the source code (=gcc=) fails.  The
     difference maps are stored in =diff*.dat= files.

     Assuming a callable installation of ruby, toggle =-r= will
     determine the /ruby difference number/ on all difference maps in
     =cxs_workshop=.  The output on the CLI may be redirected into a
     permanent record, e.g. by
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
       python3 Hirshfeld_moderator.py -r > report.txt
     #+END_SRC
     The absence of ruby will not affect other stages of the analysis.

     #+LATEX: \ \newline{}

     The visual inspection of the results is relayed to gnuplot with
     third-party module =Gnuplot.py=, which freely is available e.g.,
     with =pip=.[fn:13]  To provide an initial /overview/, call
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
       python3 Hirshfeld_moderator.py -o
     #+END_SRC
     The =*.png= in low resolution and dimension are intended to
     decide if a display with the standard map range ([0.4,2.6] \AA,
     lower left square) or translated map range ([0.8,3.0] \AA, upper
     right square) may be more suitable than the current perspective
     in extended map range ([0.4,3.0] \AA).

     #+NAME:  provision_overview
     #+CAPTION:  Example survey of 2D fingerprint maps (left, center) and difference map plot (right). Intended as guidance for setting up subsequent plots in high resolution, frames mark standard map range (left bottom, dashes) and translated map range (right atop, dots), respectively, while displaying the extended range.  The right bottom corner reports the maximal and minimal /z/-value read from the =.dat= file.

     #+ATTR_HTML:   :width 75%
     [[./doc_support/survey.png]]

     The source code by Paolo Raiteri and Andrew Rohl suggests to
     constrain the /z/-scale to [0,0.08] (2D fingerprint maps) and
     [-0.025:0.025] (difference maps).  Especially for the scrutiny of
     sets of Hirshfeld surface analyses, it may be particularly useful
     to adjust these limits for whole series (cf. below).  It is for
     this reason the lowest and highest /z/-value in the =*.dat= files
     are reported both in the images, as well as in a permanent record
     written, =gp_report.txt=.[fn:11]

     The high-resolution plots about 2D /fingerprint/ or /difference
     maps/ are provided either as =*.pdf=, or =*.png=.  This is
     concatenated in the instruction, e.g.,
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
       python3 Hirshfeld_moderator --dpng e
     #+END_SRC
     to generate /difference maps/ as =*.png=.  The explicit =e= sets
     the plot for the /extended/ map range ([0.4,3.0] \AA).
     Alternatively, =s= calls for the /standard/, and =t= for the
     /translated/ map range of [0.4,2.6] \AA, and [0.8,3.0] \AA.

     Both types of high-resolution maps deploy /as adjustable
     default/ a /z/-range of [0.00,0.08] (2D fingerprint maps) and
     [-0.025,0.025] (difference maps).  It is optional to override
     these defaults in line of, e.g.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
       python3 Hirshfeld_moderator.py --dpng e --zmax 0.03
     #+END_SRC
     to limit the /z/-range of the difference map to [-0.03,0.03].

     To ease comparison across series of data, the highest and lowest
     /z/-value recorded in the =*.dat= data will be displayed in the
     plot.  Equally, =Hirshfeld_moderator.py= may exchange the color
     palettes used by the optional toggle =-a=.  This then activates
     palettes perceptually safer, e.g. for an output constrained to
     gray-scale.

     Independent of the color-palette selected, the high-resolution
     output may use a neuter gray background.  This is invoked by the
     optional toggle =-g=.

  Below, the effect of color palette and background selection is
  illustrated.  They each display the fingerprint about either CSD
  model =BZAMID01=, or =BZAMID11=; the difference plot for the two
  fingerprints as determined by ImageMagick's =compare=, and the
  computed difference map as displayed by gnuplot.

  Note that the diagrams plot may be either =*.png= (e.g., by invoking
  =--dpng e=), or resolution independent format =*.pdf= (e.g., by
  invoking =--dpdf s=).  Thanks to gnuplot's /conditional
  plotting/,[fn:8] the vector-based output tends to be less large than
  the bitmap.

* Footnotes

[fn:13] In preparation of this guide, =Gnuplot.py= in version 1.8 was
used successfully.

[fn:12] In preparation of this guide, =gfortran= in version 7.4.0 was
used successfully.

[fn:11] The entries may be sorted, e.g., by =sort -k4 -n input.txt -o
output.txt=, as  =sort= is part of the GNU coreutils.

[fn:9] Note that if you would like to use these bash =.sh= scripts as
gnuplot =.plt= files, occasionally instructions like =\$= (with
backslash) escaping the shell need to be reset as =$= (without
backslash).

[fn:8] Thanks to Ethan Merrit who suggested this additional
improvement in a private communication.  The reduction of file volume
is especially observed for the generation of =*.pdf=.

[fn:7] In preparation of this guide, =gcc= in version 7.4.0 was used
successfully.

[fn:6] The script successfully works with gfortran (version 7.4.0).
The optimization of the executable (=-O= parameter) does not offer a
noticeable advantage if comparing a few model data.
