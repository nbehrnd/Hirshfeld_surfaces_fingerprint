* Background

  The electronic interaction of a molecule with its neighbors in the crystalline
  state may be described by the Hirshfeld
  surface[fn:SpackmanM_1997]^{,} [fn:McKinnonJ_2004]^{,} [fn:HirshfeldSurface]
  accessible by CrystalExplorer.[fn:CrystalExplorer] This 3D surface may be
  projected as a normalized 2D fingerprint map.[fn:2Dfingerprint]

  To identify similarities and differences among crystallographic
  models with greater ease, Carter[fn:Carter_2017] suggest
  the inspection of /difference maps/ of these normalized 2D
  fingerprint maps.  This extends the qualitative, visual comparison
  of the maps /as images/, e.g. with ImageMagick's =compare=
  instruction,[fn:compare_command] by a computed comparison of
  normalized fingerprint map data where differences are quantified
  locally.  Summing up any information in each difference map
  eventually may condense the analysis to a /difference number/.  The
  figure below illustrates the comparison of two polymorphs of
  benzamide.

  #+NAME:    alignment
  #+CAPTION: Normalized 2D fingerprint maps of Hirshfeld surfaces for CCDC model BZAMID01 and BZAMID11 (left and left center) about benzamide.  Both fingerprints are derived from the analysis by CrystalExplorer at /very high/ resolution ($d_i$ and $d_e$ in the extended map range of 0.40--3.00 \AA, with a 0.01 \AA increment each).  Qualitative difference assignment by superposition  provided by ImageMagick (right center); each red pixel indicates /any/ difference between the two images inspected.  Quantitative spatial information provided by the /computed difference map/ with the scripts of this repository (right).

* workflow

** setup of CrystalExplorer

  /Prior/ to this analysis, the Hirshfeld surface needs to be computed
  by CrystalExplorer.[fn:CrystalExplorer] By default, the information
  required here is stored in intermediate =.cxs= files.  To retain
  these data, open CrystalExplorer and access the "expert tab" in the
  menu accessible /via/ =File= \rightarrow =Preferences=.  Disable the
  check mark next to "remove working files".  (This change will remain
  active -- even if CrystalExplorer is relaunched -- until you
  intentionally revert the options by clicking on "Restore Expert
  Settings".)

  Equally note, computations in CrystalExplorer preparing the
  difference fingerprint analysis require the /very high/ level of
  resolution.  This is one level above the one CrystalExplorer
  suggests you by default, just prior to its computation.

** subsequent processing of CrystalExplorer's data, default

  To normalize the fingerprint map, compile the Fortran
  =fingerprint.f90= e.g., with gfortran.[fn:gfortran]  In the
  subsequent use, indicate if the output should cover standard (0.4 -
  2.6), translated (0.8 - 3.0), or extended range (0.4 - 3.0 A), e.g.

  #+begin_src shell :tangle no
    gfortran fingerprint.f90 -o fingerprint
    ./fingerprint input.cxs [standard | translated | extended] output.dat
  #+end_src

  For the computation of the difference map, compile the C code e.g.,
  with gcc.[fn:gcc]  Ensure to submit exactly two normalized maps of
  same dimension (for instance, both extended range), e.g.

  #+begin_src shell :tangle no
    gcc diff_finger.c -o diff_finger
    ./diff_finger input_A.dat input_B.dat > difference.dat
  #+end_src

  The difference between two normalized maps can be summed up with a
  script written in Ruby.[fn:ruby]  Run e.g.,

  #+begin_src shell :tangle no
    $ ruby ./sum_abs_diffs.rb diff_BZAMID01_BZAMID11.dat 
    diff_BZAMID01_BZAMID11.dat  61.4040
  #+end_src

** additions to the original code

  To familiarize with the approach, sub folder =testdata= contains
  .cif, DataWarrior's .cxs as well as results of the above processing
  for two structure models, =BZAMID01= and =BZAMID11=.

  Sub folder =incubator= contains source code added after the
  publication by Carter /et al./ This is to provide e.g., a mean to
  compute the difference map and calculate the difference number with
  Fortran alone.

  Sub folder =plot2gnuplot= contains a couple of bash scripts to
  invoke gnuplot[fn:gnuplot] to visualize the results either as bitmap
  (png format), or vector graphics (pdf).  For details, see its
  separate documentation.

  The figures below illustrate the visual output using defaults (first
  row), or with optional parameters (second row).  Each row depicts
  two normalized fingerprints either compared with ImageMagick's
  =compare=, or as a computed difference map.  The lower row
  illustrates usage of an optional non-white background as well as an
  optional color map considered "safer" for visual inspection than
  gnuplot's =jet= (because of perceptual uniformity with monotonically
  increasing luminance).
