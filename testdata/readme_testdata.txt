This folder contains 'typical data' to work with the scripts provided
in this repository.  Both crystallographic model data, BZAMID01.cif
and BZAMID11.cif are available from the CCDC CSD data base at

https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/structures/

The zip-compressed subfolders with their name contain both in addition
the renamed .cxs file generated by CrystalExplorer (version 17.5), the
normalized Hirshfeld surface 2D fingerprint .dat data file, the .sh
deployed and .png example export by gnuplot (version 5.2.7).

zip-compressed subfolder difference_BZAMID01_BZAMID11 contains both the
difference fingerprint map data .dat file, the .sh to relay ti gnuplot
to generate the corresponding map as .png.

To lower the file size in the repository, gnuplot's .png were scaled to
a half with Imagemagick's mogrify

mogrify -scale 1836 example.png

File compare_BZAMID01_11.png is the result of comparing gnuplot's scaled
.png with Imagemagick, i.e.

compare BZAMID01.png BZAMID11.png compare_BZAMID01_BZAMID11.png

which (currently) works for compare only for RGB .png, excluding the RGBa
type maps with alpha (transparency) channel and 'conditional plotting'.
