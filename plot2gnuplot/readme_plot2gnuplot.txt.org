This folder, plot2gnuplot, contains a few bash scripts requiring a
.dat data file and gnuplot.  Because these relate to visualization,
rather than to the computation the Fortran, C and Ruby code provide,
they were brought into this sub-folder.  This readme provides a brief
description about these scripts relaying to gnuplot.  They either

+ provide 2D fingerprint maps of Hirshfeld surfaces as already
  introduced by CrystalExplorer.  Their expected input is the .dat
  file provided by the compiled Fortan executable of fingerprint.F90.
  These scripts are named in line of plot_finger.  Or

+ provide difference maps of 2D fingerprints.  Their expected input is
  the .dat file provided by the compiled C executable diff_finger.c.
  These scripts are named in line of plot_diff_finger.

At present, the sub-folder contains these scripts:

+ plot_finger_png.sh, added 2019-11-03.

  Initially provided as plot_finger by Paolo Raiteri and Andrew Rohl
  to provide a fingerprint map in a color scheme as seen in
  CrystalExplorer (version 17.5).  After regrouping the instructions,
  the .png generated now equally contains both the de and di label, as
  well as the stem of the file read.  In reference to the original,
  the point size of was lowered to prevent overlap of the tiles within
  the scatter plot.  Assuming a 300 dpi resolution, the bitmap
  (3674x3229 px) is about 12.2 x 10.8 in or about 4.8 x 4.2 cm wide.

+ plot_diff_finger_png.sh, added 2019-11-03.

  Initially set up as plot_diff_finger by Paolo Raiteri and Andrew
  Rohl to provide a difference map of two Hirshfeld surface
  fingerprints.  The map's color scheme ranges from blue (negative
  values) over white (neuter level) to red (positive values).
  Mirroring the pattern in plot_finger_png.sh, the original script was
  reorganized, too.  Assuming a 300 dpi resolution, the .png bitmap
  (3674x3229 px) is about 12.2 x 10.8 in or about 4.8 x 4.2 cm wide.

+ plot_finger_pdf.sh, added 2019-11-04.

  Derived from plot_finger_png.sh to provide a fingerprint map with a
  color scheme as with CrystalExplorer (version 17.5) in the vector
  format .pdf.  Canvas size originally set up to 6.0 x 6.0 cm (about
  2.4 x 2.4 in).

+ plot_diff_finger_pdf.sh, added 2019-11-04.

  Derived from plot_finger_pdf.sh and plot_diff_finger_png.sh to
  provide an export in the resolution independent .pdf format of the
  difference map of two 2D fingerprint maps.  Canvas size originally
  set up to 6.0 x 6.0 cm (about 2.4 x 2.4 in).

+ plot_finger_pdf_sparse.sh, added 2019-11-04.

  Derived from plot_finger_pdf.sh.  As indicated by Ethan Merrit,
  gnuplot includes the concept of 'conditional printing', which here
  considers only tiles to contribute to the scatter plot if their
  z-value is greater than zero.  By visual inspection, the difference
  may be invisible if the threshold criterion's color representation
  (here, 0-level = white) equates the visual perception (e.g., white
  paper backgroun).  However, the size of a .pdf map generated this
  way may be less than a half of a 'classic map', with similar gain in
  overall processing, too.

  Resolution independent .pdf export with a canvas originally set up
  to 6.0 x 6.0 cm (about 2.4 x 2.4 in).

+ plot_diff_finger_pdf_sparse.sh, added 2019-11-04.

  Derived from plot_diff_finger_pdf.sh and Ethan Merrit's hint about
  'conditional plotting'.  Contrasting to the former example then
  using an unilateral criterion, now a bilateral criterion is deployed
  (the absolute value of z).

  Resolution independent .pdf export with a canvas originally set up
  to 6.0 x 6.0 cm (about 2.4 x 2.4 in).

+ plot_finger_png_sparse.sh, added 2019-11-04.

  Derived from plot_finger_png.sh, starting with an otherwise
  transparent .png 4096x4096 px bitmap and requesting the 'conditional
  printing'.  In comparison to the output by analogue output script
  plot_finger_pdf_sparse.sh, the volume of the .png file actually is
  10...20% greater than the .pdf file.

  Assuming a 300 dpi resolution, the .png bitmap (3674x3229 px)
  eventually provided is about 12.2 x 10.8 in (about 4.8 x 4.2 cm).

+ plot_diff_finger_png_sparse.sh, added 2019-11-04.

  Derived from plot_diff_finger_png.sh, modified along the patterns in
  script plot_finger_png_sparse.sh (transparent canvas for pngcairo)
  as well as conditional printing with bilateral threshold (as in
  script plot_diff_finger_pdf_sparse.sh.  Savings in file size in
  reference to a conventional .png exported map are small (about 10%),
  depending on picture viewer, however, the visual recognition of
  pixels annotated by pale red or pale blue only may be easier than
  with a bright white background.

  Assuming a 300 dpi resolution, the .png bitmap (3674x3229 px)
  eventually provided is about 12.2 x 10.8 in (about 4.8 x 4.2 cm).
