This folder, plot2gnuplot, contains a few bash scripts requiring a
.dat data file and gnuplot.  Because these relate to visualization,
rather than to the computation the Fortran, C and Ruby code provide,
they were brought into this sub-folder.  This readme provides a brief
description about these scripts relaying to gnuplot.  They either

+ provide 2D fingerprint maps of Hirshfeld surfaces as already
  introduced by CrystalExplorer.  Their expected input is the .dat
  file provided by the compiled Fortan executable of fingerprint.F90.
  These scripts are named in line of plot_finger.  Or

+ provide difference maps of 2D fingerprints.  Their expected input is
  the .dat file provided by the compiled C executable diff_finger.c.
  These scripts are named in line of plot_diff_finger.

At present, the sub-folder contains these scripts:

+ plot_finger_png.sh, added 2019-11-03.

  Initially provided as plot_finger by Paolo Raiteri and Andrew Rohl
  to provide a fingerprint map in a color scheme as seen in
  CrystalExplorer (version 17.5).  After regrouping the instructions,
  the .png generated now equally contains both the de and di label, as
  well as the stem of the file read.  In reference to the original,
  the point size of was lowered to prevent overlap of the tiles within
  the scatter plot.  Assuming a 300 dpi resolution, the bitmap
  (3674x3229 px) is about 12.2 x 10.8 in or about 4.8 x 4.2 cm wide.

+ plot_diff_finger_png.sh, added 2019-11-03.

  Initially set up as plot_diff_finger by Paolo Raiteri and Andrew
  Rohl to provide a difference map of two Hirshfeld surface
  fingerprints.  The map's color scheme ranges from blue (negative
  values) over white (neuter level) to red (positive values).
  Mirroring the pattern in plot_finger_png.sh, the original script was
  reorganized, too.  Assuming a 300 dpi resolution, the .png bitmap
  (3674x3229 px) is about 12.2 x 10.8 in or about 4.8 x 4.2 cm wide.
